          "text": "The Copper Mountain mine is located on the Similkameen River in south-central British Columbia, approximately 20 km south of Princeton. Copper Mountain is an open-pit operation that produces copper, gold and silver, and it currently employs about 425 people full time.\r\rCopper Mountain was historically known as both the Similco Mine and the Similkameen Mine, operating from 1972 to 1996 under Mines Act permit M-29. The mine was placed under care and maintenance in 1996. In April 2009, the Ministry of Energy and Mines received an application for an amendment to Mines Act permit M-29 to approve a new mine plan for what is now the Copper Mountain operation. Issued on April 1, 2010, the Mines Act permit amendment authorized mining activities at the Copper Mountain mine site to resume. The mine re-opened in June 2011.\r\rThe current mine plan includes a production area located on Copper Mountain itself, located on the east side of the Similkameen River between the river and Wolfe Creek. In the past, mining also took place on a portion of the property called Ingerbelle, located on the west side of the Similkameen River. The entire mine property, including both Ingerbelle and Copper Mountain, covers an area of approximately\r74 km2. As of the end of 2015, about 1,444 hectares of this property have been disturbed by mining activities�1,196 hectares on the Copper Mountain side, and approximately 248 hectares on the Ingerbelle side. Progressive reclamation has been undertaken at the site since the 1970s.",

Mining has taken place on the Elkview Operations site for over 100 years, and large-scale open-pit mining began in the late 1960s. Proven and probable reserves at Elkview are projected to support mining at planned production rates for the next four decades. The mine currently employs about 955 people full time.\r\rElkview Operations received the 2009 Coal Mining Category Reclamation Award from the BC Technical and Research Committee on Reclamation for clean-up work and removal of historical mining debris at Michel Creek.",
