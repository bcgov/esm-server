				You can enter additional words into the search box to increase your results. For example, entering
				<strong><em>memo letter</em></strong> will
				find documents that contain either of those words. Entering <strong><em>"memo letter"</em></strong>
				will find documents that contain that exact phrase.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can narrow your search results by adding a hyphen (minus sign) in front of any word or phrase you wish to
				exclude from the search.
				For example, <strong><em>memo -letter</em></strong> will find documents containing the
				word <strong><em>memo</em></strong>, but not the word <strong><em>letter</em></strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This search feature turns up results based on file names and descriptions. To search the contents of an
				individual document, you must first view or download it and then perform a search within the document itself.
